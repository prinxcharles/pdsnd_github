### Description
<<<<<<< HEAD
Bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. it has become quite convenient for a rider to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, we perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
